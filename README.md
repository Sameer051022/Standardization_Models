# Standardization in Machine Learning Models

This Jupyter notebook showcases the application of standardization techniques on numerical data prior to training various machine learning models. The notebook aims to provide insights into how data scaling can influence model accuracy and performance.

## Overview
The notebook presents a detailed workflow where numerical features are standardized using sklearn's StandardScaler before applying machine learning models. This approach is crucial for models that are sensitive to the scale of input data, such as logistic regression and SVM.

## Libraries Used
- pandas for data handling
- sklearn for preprocessing and model building

## Usage
Ensure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed to run this notebook. It's designed for both educational purposes and as a template for more specific data science projects involving standardized data.

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome, especially in terms of adding more models or improving the existing preprocessing and analysis pipeline.
